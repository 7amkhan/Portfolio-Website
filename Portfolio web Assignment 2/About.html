    <hr>
    <p class="abouttxt2">So my name is <STRONg>Saim Ahmed Siddiqui</STRONg>. I'm 18 years old. I was born in <strong>Saudia Arabia</strong> <em>(Dharan)</em>  
    I live there for 1.5 years and then we settled in <em>(Karachi)</em> <strong> Pakistan</strong>. I live with my family including mom, dad, a younger 
    sister and me. So as soon as we settled in <em>(Karachi)</em> <strong> Pakistan</strong> then I took admission in <strong>The Educators School</strong> 
    and left after I've completed grade one. And then I've completed my matricular in computer-science from <strong>"St'Patricks Boys High School"</strong>  
    <em>(Sadder Karachi)</em> and later my intermidiate in pre-engeneering from <strong>"Govt.City College"</strong> <em>(Morning)</em> 
    and right now I took admission in <em>(SMIU)</em> <strong>"Sindh Madarsa-Tul-Islam University"</strong> having a faculty 
    of bachlors of business-administration. As well as doing web & mobile apps development course from <em>(SMIT)</em> <strong>"Saylani Mass IT Tranning"</strong>. 
    A part of all this education info I'm very interested as well as its my hobby to play and watch football, where as I use to do editting 
    and taking photography in my free time as well and I enjoy doing all these activities. I love to play outdoor game such as football, vollyball,
    basketball, badminton, and cricket a bit. I played football, basketball and and vollyball at school level where we have different teams as well as
    with different schools and I'm kinda professional in these three game according to my point of view and even I'm very good in badminton tho.
    Insted of this I'm very good in cooking too. My aim in life is to become a web developer and be a kind and helpfull person to hep people who 
    are in need of anything, I want to be rich & successful in future for myself but not only for myself but for my parents too because the spend billions (infinite) 
    on me so, I want to be secessful for them as well and for myself for my better future and for other my relatives, my friends or 
    any other person in need so for that I'm studying hard in between I quit studing but now as I want all these dreams to turn true in real life
    so I started studying hard again and hope so <strong>INSHALLAH</strong> I'll achive my goals/aim so I can full-fill my need.</p>
